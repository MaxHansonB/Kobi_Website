					“Crisis Prices: The Ethics of Market Controls During a Global Pandemic”
					[With Ewan Kingston] Business Ethics Quarterly
					<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-ethics-quarterly/article/crisis-prices-the-ethics-of-market-controls-during-a-global-pandemic/40F0723E845CAAE00843818369E7D967" target="_blank">

				<p class="abstract">
					SARS-CoV-2 has unleashed an unprecedented global crisis that has caused the
					demand for essential goods, such as medical and sanitation products, to soar
					while simultaneously disrupting the very supply chains that allow individuals
					and institutions to obtain those essential goods. This has resulted in stark
					price increases and accusations of price gouging. We survey the existing
					philosophical literature that examines price gouging and identify the key
					arguments for regulators permitting such behavior and for regulators restricting
					such behavior. We demonstrate how the existing accounts are designed for localized
					emergencies rather than global persistent crises such as the coronavirus pandemic.
					In light of this, we highlight an understudied justification for price gouging that
					is much more salient during global crises: incentivizing increased production of
					essential goods. Furthermore, we pinpoint three conditions that help determine
					whether authorities should restrict price gouging during the coronavirus pandemic
					and similar global crises.

					"Darwinian Rational Expectations" Journal of Economic Methodology 
					[Conditionally Accepted with Minor Revisions - Contact for Draft]
				<p>

				<p class="abstract">
					The rational expectations hypothesis holds that agents should be modeled as not making
					systematic forecasting errors and has become a central model-building principle of modern
					economics. The hypothesis is often justified on the grounds that it coheres with the
					general methodological principle of economic rationality. In this article, I propose a
					novel Darwinian market justification for rational expectations which does not require
					either structural knowledge or statistical learning, as is commonly required in the
					economic literature. Rather, this Darwinian market account reconceives rationality as a
					market level phenomenon instead of as an individualistic property.
