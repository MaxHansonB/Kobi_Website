			I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Philosophy and an Affiliated Faculty Member with the Philosophy, 
			Politics, and Economics Minor Program at the University of San Diego.

			<br><br>I work in Philosophy of Science and Economics, Business Ethics, and Philosophy, Politics, and Economics. 
			My research lies at the intersection of philosophy and economics and is focused on the epistemic capacities of 
			scientific models, the role of expectations and uncertainty in economic thought, and the rights and obligations 
			of managers, workers, regulators, and researchers.

			<br><br>Previously, I was a Visiting Scholar in the Center for the History of Political Economy at Duke University and a 
			Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Smith Institute for Political Economy and Philosophy at Chapman University. 
			Prior to coming to Chapman, I earned my PhD in Philosophy and an MA in Economics from Duke University. 
			Before that, I earned an MA in Philosophy from University College London and a BSc in Philosophy from the 
			London School of Economics.
